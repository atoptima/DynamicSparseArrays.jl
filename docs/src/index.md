# DynamicSparseArrays

** Documentation is work in progress**

This package aims to provide dynamic sparse vectors 
and matrix in Julia. 
Unlike the sparse arrays provided in `SparseArrays`, 
arrays from this package have unfixed size. 
It means that we can add or delete rows and 
columns after the instantiation of the array.

This package is a work in progress.
We welcome any contributions.


## Installation

Install the package through the package manager of Julia.
In the julia terminal, press the key ']' to access the package manager. Then, run the following command : 

```
pkg> add DynamicSparseArrays
```

You can start using `DynamicSparseArrays` by doing :
```julia
using Coluna
```
